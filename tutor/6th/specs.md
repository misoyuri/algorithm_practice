# Assignment Overview

Hashtables are a powerful data structure known for their support of insertion, deletion, and lookups in O(1) time. This O(1) performance makes them a go-to structure for programmers in all domains, from software engineering to scientfic computing to machine learning. Other data structures we have discussed, such as linked lists (O(n) lookup, insertion, and deletion), and AVL Trees (O(logn) lookup, insertion, and deletion) lack that O(1) ability across the board.

Believe it or not, you're already familiar with hashtables: Python dictionaries and C++ unordered maps are implemented as hashtables under the hood. 

In this project, you'll be refining your hashtable expertise by implementing a hashtable from scratch in Python and applying it to an application problem involving the management of message posts.

The implementation, inspired by a [2012 post to the Python mailing list](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/578375/), will maintain insertion-ordering, supporting iteration over keys, values, and key-value pairs such that items are returned during iteration in the order they were inserted. It will also exploit locality-of-reference cache optimization by replacing a sparse table of (large) entries with a more space-efficient sparse table of (small) indices indexing into a dense table of (large) entries. 

Quoting from the post,

    The current memory layout for dictionaries is unnecessarily inefficient.
    It has a sparse table of 24-byte entries containing the hash value, key pointer, and value pointer.
    Instead, the 24-byte entries should be stored in a dense table referenced by a sparse table of indices.
    For example, the dictionary:

    d = {'timmy': 'red', 'barry': 'green', 'guido': 'blue'}

    is currently stored as:

    entries = [['--', '--', '--'],
               [-8522787127447073495, 'barry', 'green'],
               ['--', '--', '--'],
               ['--', '--', '--'],
               ['--', '--', '--'],
               [-9092791511155847987, 'timmy', 'red'],
               ['--', '--', '--'],
               [-6480567542315338377, 'guido', 'blue']]

    Instead, the data should be organized as follows:

    indices =  [None, 1, None, None, None, 0, None, 2]
    entries =  [[-9092791511155847987, 'timmy', 'red'],
                [-8522787127447073495, 'barry', 'green'],
                [-6480567542315338377, 'guido', 'blue']]

In lecture, we discussed hashtable architectures similar to the former, entries-only setup mentioned above. 

In this project, we deal with an architecture similar to the latter, indices-and-entries setup mentioned above. A graphical summary of the architecture used in this project is presented below.

# Assignment Notes

1. Using any of the following will result in the **loss of all testcase and manual points** associated with the
   violating function.
    1. a Python dictionary or set,
    2. a Python container/collection other than a basic list or tuple, or
    3. the nonlocal keyword
2. Calling magic or protected methods improperly in this project will result in a **2 point deduction for each violation, up to a maximum of 20 points.**
    1. Calling a magic method like \_\_len\_\_() with the syntax `table.__len__()` instead of the proper
       syntax `len(table)` is a violation
    2. Calling a protected method like \_insert() outside of its implementing class, e.g., in the application problem,
       is a violation (use \_\_setitem\_\_() instead)
    3. Read below to learn more about magic methods and protected methods
3. Changing function signatures will result in a **2 point deduction for each violation, up to a maximum of 20 points.**
   1. When working with libraries, open-source codebases, or industry codebases, you will rarely be able to change function signatures, so it's good practice to avoid it now!
   2. Changing function signatures will often cause testcases to fail, too.
4. In this project, you will be implementing and using many of Python's _magic methods_.
    1. Magic methods have two underscores on the front and the back, such as \_\_len\_\_().
    2. In this project, these magic methods won't be doing much, they will call the other protected methods that you
       write!
    3. In other words, these magic methods should not be more than a few lines.
    4. Refer to the syntax table below to see how the magic methods relate to other methods in this project.
5. In this project, you will also be implementing and using _protected methods_.
    1. Protected methods are methods prefaced with a single underscore, such as a function called \_insert().
    2. Protected methods are meant only to be called inside other functions within the class.
    3. This is Python's way of implementing the C++ equivalent of private methods; protected methods meant to be treated
       as private. Protected methods should not be called outside of the implementing class, which means they should not
       be called in the application problem.
    4. Refer to the syntax table below to see how the protected methods relate to other methods in this project.
6. In this project, you'll be using Python generators to iterate over hashtable keys/values in a space-efficient manner
   1. Unlike an iteration returned in a list using *O(n)* space, a traversal returning a generator will use *O(1)* space by *yielding* each key/value in a sequential, on-demand manner
   2. See [this link](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) for a nice introduction to Python generators
7. Make sure you split the work between the magic and hidden methods appropriately.
    1. The majority of the testing will take place in the magic method testcases of \_\_setitem\_\_(), \_\_getitem\_\_()
       , and \_\_delitem\_\_() to simulate real-world use.
    2. As shown in the syntax table below, however, the magic methods \_\_setitem\_\_(), \_\_getitem\_\_(), and
       \_\_delitem\\_\_() will call the protected methods \_insert(), \_get(), and \_delete(), and these protected
       methods should handle all of the logic associated with insertion, lookup, and deletion.
    3. Use the small testcases for the \_insert(), \_get(), and \_delete() functions to make sure you are dividing the
       work properly.
    4. Magic methods should not be more than a few lines.
8. If you inspect \_hash\_1 and \_hash\_2, you will see that they depend on the size of the string. For the purposes of
   this assignment, treat these as taking O(1) (constant) time.
9. A few guarantees:
   1. Capacity will not grow past ~1000
   2. All keys will be of type string

The following syntax table shows how protected methods, magic methods, and calls to magic methods relate to each other.

| Protected                 | Magic                           | How to Use Magic  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|

| _insert(self, key, value) | \__setitem\__(self, key, value) | self[key] = value |
| _get(self, key)           | \__getitem\__(self, key)        | self[key]         |
| _delete(self, key)        | \__delitem\__(self, key)        | del self[key]     |
|                           | \__contains\__(self, key)       | key in self       |

* **\_insert(self, key: str, value: T) -> None**
    * Use the key and value parameters to add an entry to the hashtable
        * The new HashNode should be appended to self.entries
        * self.indices[i] should be set such that self.entries[self.indices[i]] retrieves the new HashNode, where i is the integer index returned by \_hash()
        * If the key exists, overwrite the existing value
          * This means you will need to call \_hash() with inserting=False first to check if a key exists, then call \_hash() a second time with inserting=True to find the location of insertion if the key does not exist 
        * In the event that inserting causes the table to have a load factor of 0.5 or greater you must grow the table
          to double the existing capacity. This should use the \_grow() method.

# Application Problem: Discord Destroyer

![](./img/discord_logo.png)

Sometimes people get fed up with their favorite social media platforms and wish they could alter it to their will. With this problem we will be fighting the behemoth platform that is Discord. In order to make something better eventually, we need to at least have the same basic functionality.

This comes in the form of starting with the basic functionality of a **channel**. A channel contains the fundamentals for functionality for a platform like this. Users are able to send a message, delete a message, get the most recent posts in order, and search through a user's messages.

To implement this functionality as efficiently as possible you will have to use two separate hashtables, a 1D HashTable to store the posts that are in a channel by 1D and 2D hashtable to store users' posts for quick iteration.

In order to circumvent the issue of users' future posts overwriting the past posts, each post must generate a unique post id and the key for storing will be a string in the form "user,post id". 

*Note: No username will contain the character ','

#### Example 1

Suppose user "algorithmsfan2002" makes a post "I love Data Structures," and suppose this post creates the id "331" when generate_post_id is called with this user and message. Then the key for this post within the posts_by_id hashtable will be "algorithmsfan2002,331" and self.posts_by_id["algorithmsfan2002,331"] will hold "I love Data Structures". 

This key "algorithmsfan2002,331" will also be the value stored within the users dictionary for fast lookup by user when we wish to get posts by user. In this example, the key "algorithmsfan2002,331" will be stored at self.ids_by_user["algorithmsfan2002"]["331"].

#### Example 2
    
- If these four posts are posted (from top to bottom oldest to newest)
  - "Hash(Table) Slinging Slasher" : "I love hashing algorithms!"
  - "Patrick A-Star" : "Remember your space complexity!"
  - "Hash(Table) Slinging Slasher" : "O(1) Lookups rule!"
  - "Patrick A-Star" : "NuDiscord rules!"

This ordering of posts will create the posts_by_id table that looks like this diagram:

![](./img/331_posts_by_ids.png)

This will also create an ids_by_users table that will look like this:

![](./img/331_ids_by_users.png)

## class DiscordDestroyer

        - The keys for the inner HashTable will be in the form of "post_id"
        - The value stored in the inner HashTable will be the key for accessing the post in the channel HashTable, i.e., "user,post_id"

    - Removes the post with provided post_id from posts_by_id and ids_by_user hashtables, and returns a bool indicating whether the post was actually deleted
    - *Time Complexity: O(1)*
    - *Space Complexity: O(1)*
    - **user: str:** string representing the user who posted the post
    - **post_id: int:** int representing the post_id of the post
    - **return:** bool representing if the post with the given post_id was deleted or not

    - Returns a generator that will yield the V most recent posts
    - *Time Complexity: O(V)*
    - *Space Complexity: O(1)*
    - **v: int:** how many posts to yield
    - **return:** generator that will yield v posts
- **get_posts_by_user(self, user: str) -> Generator[Tuple[str, int, str], None, None]**
    - Returns a generator of all posts the user made
      - Be careful with time complexity on this one! 
      - There's a reason we have the ids_by_user hashtable...
    - *Space Complexity: O(1)*
    - *Time Complexity: O(P)* where *P* is the number of posts the user has made
    - **user: str:** user to get the posts from
    - **return:** generator that will yield all the users posts

* Manual (30)
    * Time and space complexity points are **all-or-nothing** for each function. If you fail to meet time **or**
      space complexity in a given function, you do not receive manual points for that function.
    * Do not change the function signatures, (several point loss)
    * Loss of 1 point per missing docstring (max 3 point loss)
    * Loss of 2 points per improper method call (max 20 point loss)
      * Improper magic method call (e.g., using `table.__len__()` instead of `len(table)`)
      * Calling a protected method outside of its implementing class (e.g., calling `table._insert()` in application problem)
    * Loss of 2 points per changed function signature (max 20 point loss)
    * HashTable Time/Space: \_\_/22
